          Hello, I'm Erin, an aspiring UX/UI designer with a background in
          traditional and fine art.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am now in my second year of
          intending to pursue a bachelorâ€™s degree specializing in UX Design
          through the School of Information and minoring in Art and Design
          through Penny W. Stamps at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor.
        </p>

        <p>
          My background in traditional and fine art, specifically illustration,
          has led me to exploring different forms of art. As I've explored the
          various types of art, I started to discover a passion for design. I
          now also enjoy digital painting, creating graphics for social media,
          as well as designing websites, signs, logos. I was first introduced to
          UX/UI Design in high school where I took a Website Development course
          and am now pursuing it!
        </p>

        <p>
          Aside from art and design, some of my all-time favorite hobbies
          include trying new food spots with friends and family, creating oddly
          specific Spotify playlists, and spending time with my dog, River!
